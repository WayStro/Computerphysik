## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{Rcpp}
double zetafunktion(double s,int genauigkeit)
{
    double x = 0;
    for (long int i = pow(10, genauigkeit);(i > 0); i--)
    {
        x += 1/(pow(i, s));
    }
    Rprintf("Zeta(2) = %.15f\n", x);
    return x;
}
```

```{r}
C = zetafunktion(2, 10);
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
